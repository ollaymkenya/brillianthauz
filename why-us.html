        <p>Dear business builder,</p>
        <p id="section1">Here's is the big idea in 30 words ...</p>
        <h6>
          There are
          <span class="realistic-marker__highlight">
            better, easier, safer, faster options / pathways</span
          >
          to achieving monumental business growth, influence and success than
          what you currently subscribe to.
        </h6>
        <h6>The problem is you just don't see them!</h6>
        <p>
          Or, better yet, there are literally hundreds, if not thousands of
          ideas in your business and personal life
          <strong>right now</strong>, that can propel you to levels of success
          which seem unattainable.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are often so <b>simple, so logical and obvious</b>, yet so
          <b>unrecognizable</b> to the untrained eye, that you'll wonder how you
          didn't see them in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>And here's the skinny....</p>
        <p>
          You
          <b>
            don't need to be an expert
          </b>
          to identify such ideas.
        </p>
        <h6>
          You just need a level of exposure to understand what's possible.
        </h6>
        <p>
          In your best interests as a business builder, I would recommend that
          you constantly take time to travel outside your industry, your
          company, or geography, to study other success models.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the broad spectrum, you will get access to mind—blowing strategies,
          power practices and principles you can borrow, adapt, or adopt to your
          current business that can blow you away in a results fashion.
        </p>
        <p>But this activity will do something far better for you...</p>
        <p>
          It will expand your sense of possibilities, your goals, and your
          perception of what's possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know this because it's what I've been doing for my entire business
          life.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this newfound knowledge has enabled me to pull off a couple of
          'stunts' recently in my career.

    <div class="fancy-background row">
      <div class="constrained-width">
        <p>For example;</p>
        <ul class="u-list">
          <li>
            I recently negotiated with a firm, for access to their buyer list
            <strong>(2500 clients to be precise)</strong> for zero cost on a
            <strong>purely performance</strong>
            basis, for another business to sell their products to.
          </li>
          <li>
            I also recently negotiated for a package, including;
            <strong>
              office rental space, 3 employees on a payroll and advertising
              space for a business
            </strong>
            I'm working with, all on a purely performance commission basis upon
            every sale; meaning, I got all these assets for no cost upfront.
          </li>
          <li>
            I'm currently in the middle of a negotiation with a lead generation
            company, to have access to as many as
            <strong>
              250,000 quality leads a month, still, for no cost, only on a
              purely performance basis </strong
            >, for a business struggling to generate leads on their own.
          </li>
          <li>
            I'm also in the middle of another deal between a company that has a
            considerable amount of inventory, stock and credibility, to another
            company that has a set of buyers, but doesn't recognize the
            potential and/or capacity of
            <strong>monetizing their current buyers</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            I'm also currently helping a friend, who is trying to start a
            business, but has a 'capital problem.' Now I don't know about you,
            but I hate overheads and enormous expenses. So in a session with
            him, I showed him a way around the huge capital problem, and he is
            on course to start his business,
            <strong>
              without the risk, capital and unnecessary expenditure it would
              otherwise take!!
            </strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="constrained-width">
        <p>
          I could go on and on...
        </p>
        <p>
          It may impress you to maybe think of me as an expert.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I'm not! neither do I particularly care about being one.
        </p>

          Studies have shown that experts often get caught up in the trap of
          <strong
            >path dependency (a heavy reliance on yestrday's tools in today's
            fast moving world) </strong
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most real or self—proclaimed experts are often impatient with new
          ideas, because they challenge their ego, piercing the armor of their
          expertise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their best retaliation thus becomes intellectually appease, with a
          heavy reliance on emotions. They are often so convincing because they
          exude confidence. They can talk calmly and knowledgeably about a
          subject, make reference to relevant facts and build a compelling logic
          for their case.
        </p>
        <p>
          This makes them more <strong>emotional thinkers</strong>, as opposed
          to <strong> logical & analytical thinkers </strong>.
        </p>
        <p>A good expert is always impressive, but still usually wrong.</p>
        <p>
          That's how great companies like Nokia and Kodak came tumbling down,
          despite having a pool of experts.

        <p>The experts are often wrong!</p>
