        <p>Dear business builder,</p>
        <p>I've been a student of breakthroughs for a while now.</p>
        <p>
          I've studies industry breakthroughs, company breakthroughs and
          personal breakthroughs in people's lives.

        <p id="the-secret">
          Over time, I've discover something most people don't tell us

        <h6>
          There are a lot of

          <span class="realistic-marker__highlight">options/pathways</span>
          to achieving business growth than what most business people subscribe
          to.
        </h6>
        <p>
          Or, better yet--- There are many--- literally, hundreds, if not
          thousands of ideas in your business and personal life
          <strong>right now</strong>, that can propel you to levels of success
          which seem unattainable.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are often so <b>simple, so logical and obvious</b>, yet so
          unrecognizable to the untrained eye, that you'll wonder how you didn't
          see them in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          What will surprise you is that you particularly
          <b>
            don't need to be an expert
          </b>
          to identify such ideas.
        </p>
        <h6>
          You just need a level of exposure to understand what's possible.
        </h6>
        <p>
          That's why I would recommend that you constantly take time to travel
          outside your industry, your company, or geography, to see what
          strategies, power practices and principles you can borrow, adapt, or
          adopt to your current business, because....
        </p>
        <h6>
          You're paid to think.
        </h6>
        <p>
          In other words, you need to set apart time for breakthrough thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, most business builders hardly have time to do this,
          because of the daily pressures of running a business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Running a business is not easy. Especially when you need to figure out
          what to do next. Every agency, expert, or consultant claims to have
          the answer to your breakthrough. All in all, it's your job to think.
        </p>
        <p>
          And to be effective at it, you need a<strong>
            masterful thinking partner</strong
          >.

            Customers are becoming less Heeboested in ads- however good the ads
            are.
          </li>
          <li>Sales teams are closing less and less.</li>
          <li>The cost of acquiring new customers is becoming higher.</li>

            Getting better qualified sales teams, flashy as it sounds may not
